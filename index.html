<p>In this assignment the premise was to take your choice of metadata and do something with it. Play with it in RAW and see what the results ended up telling you. What does colour visually do for your work? How does it affect what you have created?</p>

<p>RAW was easy to use and fun at the same time. It is a online visualization that makes whatever you are using into some form of graph. </p>

<p>In looking at the assignment I knew I wanted to create something that changed words from their original form and function, and create something that was visually appealing to me. I choose the Romantic poet William Wordsworth's Prelude Book 6 to visually change. I first tried the whole book of poetry, and although the effect was stunning, and my office mates enjoyed how it looked, it was not quite what I was looking for. I then used the first 3 verses of Book 6 to create something closer to my vision. The results create a work that has an artistic and creative visual quality of the a Romantic poem in the shape of the sun. The Romantics explored their place in the world through looking at humanist views of nature. </p>

<p>Modernist authors play with form, content, and how the words look on the page. Romantic poetry creates linguistically beautiful images through text. I created a Modern play on Romanticism or a cyber-created work of Modernist art.  I choose to do this without playing with the content of Wordsworth's text but playing with the various on-line graphs that could create the effect I was looking for.  I copy and pasted the words into a excel document and then proceeded to put them into RAW to see what I could come up with. Due to the fact there are no numbers in the data, only text,I only had a few choices available to me. However, I adore the final image. </p>

<p>In using all the text in Book 6, I ran into some issues. Although visually appealing it had too much text. I then cut it down to the first three verses and loved the result. The results were in accord to what I wanted to visually reproduce. </p>

<p>There were some issues to get to this point. I had to get Jenna to download and send me the file. These sites do not seem compatible with Window's 10. I am admitting to failing gracefully. As well, problems arose at school in that RAW would not let me download my efforts, or copy and paste the code. </p>

<a id="colorization" class="anchor" href="#colorization" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Colorization</h1>

<p>I would love to see this colorized, however, on thinking about the words and the visual processes, I preferred the grey-scale. Color is attracting and distracting at the same time. Each one of us are drawn to a color they see before anything else, for me it is blue, for others it can be red, or yellow.  However, in a effort to make a colorized version I tired Voyent and I encountered the same problems. Back to trouble. </p>

<p>In doing this assignment I am playing with a new text editor called Scrivener. Over all I am quite happy with how the editor works and am looking forward to using it in other classes. One can set this text program up to work as cue cards or as a simple text document, however, it saves your work as you go, something Windows does not, although I am told it can be set up this way. </p>

<a id="conclusion" class="anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Although I am slow from the gate, and although I do see that many things can go wrong in code, in the end the result is satisfying. One benefit I see to using this in literature is that it may be fun to show poetry to a class of undergrads to get them to think outside of the box.  </p>
