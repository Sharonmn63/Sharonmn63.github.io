# Introduction
In this assignment the premise was to take your choice of metadata and do something with it. Play with it in RAW and what the results ended up telling you. How does colour visually do for your work? How does it affect what you have created.

#Assignment Dynamics
I choose to use RAW which it is easy to use and fun at the same time. It is a online Vizualzation that makes whatever you are using into some form of graph. 

#My Personal Integration of the Assignment
In looking at the assignment I knew I wanted to create something that changed the words from their original form and function, and create something that was visually appealing to me. I choose to the Romantic poet William Wordsworth and Book 6 from the Prelude to visually change. I first tried the whole book of poetry, and although, the effect was stunning, which, my office mates enjoyed, the nerds that we are, it was not quite what I was looking for. I then used the first 3 verses of book 6 prelude to create something closer to my vision. The results do not tell me much but they do create a work that relates to me has a artistic and creative visual quality of the a Romantic poem in the shape of the sun. Romantics looks at humanities view of nature, and their place in the world. 

#Romantic and Modernism
Modernist authors played with form, content, and how the words looked on the page. Romantic poety creates linguistically beautiful images through text. I wanted to combined both and create something new and what I felt was exciting. A Modern play on Romanticism or a cyber-created work of Modernist art.  I choose to do this without playing with Wordsworth's words but playing with the various on-line graphs that could create the effect I was looking for.  I copy and pasted the words into a excel document and then proceeded to put them into RAW to see what I could come up with. Due to the fact, there are no numbers in the data, only text, it I only had a few choices available to me. However, I adore what the final effect. 

#The First Effect - All of Book 6

Although Visually appealing it had too much text. I tried the first 3 verses and love the result. The results were in accord to what I wanted to visually reproduce.

#Troubles and Woes 
There were some issues to get to this point. There is also failing gracefully. I began with no internet connection at home. As well, problems arose at school in that RAW would not let me download my efforts, or copy and paste the code. I walked away for 24 hours and whatever the issues were they righted themselves and I could download a json, and able to create the work. 

#Colourization
I would love to see this colourized, however, on thinking about the words and the visual processes, I preferred the greyscale. Colour is attracting and distracting at the same time. Each one of us are drawn to a colour they see before anything else, for me it is blue, for others it can be red, or yellow.  However, in a effort to make some of it colourized I pasted the text into Voyent and made a Word Cloud.

#New Text Editor for me
In doing this assignment I am playing with a new text editor called Scrivener. Over all I am quite happy with how the editor works and looking forward to using it in other classes. If you are interested here is the website: https://www.literatureandlatte.com/
One can set this up to work in sections as cue cards or as a simple text document, however, it saves your work as  you go, something Windows does not do. 
Also I am using Sublime Text to prepare this for my repository. 

#Conclusion
Although I am slow from the gate, I enjoyed when things FINALLY worked for me, and do see that many things can go wrong in code. It is quite frustrating at times. Although I am not sure I need to visualize my work in this manner, I will never say never, things can change and it may be fun just to show poetry to a class of undergrads to get them thinking outside of the box.
